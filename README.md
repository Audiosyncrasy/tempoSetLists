# tempoSetLists
Setlists created in the XML-compatible format PLIST

## Purpose

The Frozen Ape app "Tempo" utilizes a modified Apple-specific file format (`*.plist`) with the following file extenstion: `*.slist`. These file formats are derivatives of the `*.xml` file format and can be modified in any text editor.

Using VS Code, I created snippets for each type of song (e.g., 4/4 song with 1/4-note sub-divisions) that allow me to quickly fill-in the song title and the tempo.

The completed `*.slist` file can be sent via email and exported into the Tempo app.

## Folder Structure

Each directory in the hierarchy represents a project.
